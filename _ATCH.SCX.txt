 I don't expect you to believe that I came from the
 year 2036.


 I see that everyone would like to know more about my
 time machine.

 Time travel technology was developed by [color index="8C0000"]SERN[color index="800000"].
 They completed the first time machine in 2034.

 SERN has a monopoly on time machines.
 Not even the most powerful nations on Earth can
 acquire one,to say nothing of private citizens.
 SERN used their time machine for power. By 2036,the
 world has become a [color index="8C0000"]dystopia[color index="800000"] .

 There is no war. No conflict. However,that is a
 false peace founded on the complete eradication of
 liberty.

 My time machine is a prototype reverse-engineered
 from stolen SERN technology.
 Compared to their time machine,its capabilities are
 quite limited.

 In 2036,the world is ruled by a single all-powerful
 governing body

 They control every aspect of our lives,deciding
 what we will eat,where we will live,and whom we
 will marry. There is no privacy and no choice.


 Anybody who dares oppose them is eliminated.

 You're talking about the so-called 'Grandfather
 Paradox' That has been debunked.
 This worldline has a divergence of 0.571024%
 compared to the worldline I came from.


 Killing my father would alter divergence,creating a
 worldline where my father is dead.
 However,it would not erase this worldline. I would
 go on existing.

 SERN is a particle physics research institution.
 That hasn't changed in 2036.

 It is possible to meet your past self.
 The prevailing theory in my time is that nothing
 would happen.

 I,however,haven't met my past self.

 Worldlines are like an infinite number of rivers
 flowing in parallel.
 Along the way,they are constantly branching out
 into new worldlines.
 This is called divergence.
 For example,whether or not you post on this message
 board has practically no effect on this worldline's
 divergence.

 But if you were murdered,let's say,then divergence
 would change.

 However,it would only change by about 0.000002%,if
 that.

 A single human being's death is not terribly
 significant on a global scale.

 Wars,disasters,acts of terrorism,and other events
 that cause widespread death and destruction have a
 much greater effect on divergence.


 Thanks for telling me about tripcodes.
 I'll make sure to use this one from now on.

 I'm starting to get tired,so let's pick up again
 tomorrow.

 The Everett-Wheeler model is correct.
 Please look it up to learn more.

 It seems you're all still clinging to preconceived
 notions of time.

 Time does not simply run from past to future like a
 car on a one-way street.

 To be more specific,the laws of causality do not
 allow contradictions to occur.
 If the result of an event -- the effect -- is
 changed,the event itself -- the cause -- also
 changes to prevent a paradox.

 That's why there are so few people who can observe
 changes in divergence.

 (Divergence being the worldline's percent difference
 from the standard.)

 Don't you people have anything to offer besides
 insults? How about contributing to the discussion,
 plebeian scum!

 If you assume that time doesn't flow in a straight
 line,then the idea of time travel is much easier
 to swallow.

 In such a scenario,a time machine traveling to the
 past doesn't need to fight against the flow of time!

 I say Titor's points have merit.

 By the way,Titor,I'd like like to know more about

 No one seems particularly interested in what I said
 about time not flowing in a single direction.

 That's proof that your preconceptions are deeply
 ingrained.
 Honestly,it bothers me that you simply accept that
 as the truth.

 I'm starting to understand why SERN was able to take
 over so easily.


 Whenever a major event causes divergence to change,
 the timeline is reconstructed to prevent paradoxes
 from occurring.

 For example,let's say that a major event causes
 this worldline to diverge into a new worldline,
 call it worldline B.

 On worldline B,I'm afraid to say,@channel never
 existed.

 As the timeline is reconstructed,all of your
 memories of reading and posting on @channel will
 disappear,to be replaced by memories of you doing
 something else.

 In other words,by changing the present,you change
 the past.


 I wrote about SERN yesterday. The only other thing I
 can say is that you must not believe their lies.


 They have already succeeded at creating micro black
 holes.

 Life in 2036 is very different from what it is today.

 Most people live on farms,growing their own food.
 All forms of commerce and communication are
 restricted.
 There's no travel,no internet,no railroad even.

 Most people never see another town,let alone a city.

 Science continues to advance,of course,but the
 vast majority of people do not benefit from that
 progress.

 Technology belongs only to those chosen by SERN and
 the Committee of 300.

 It's very peaceful,at least on the surface.
 There's none of the conflict you see in this era.

 The world in 2036 is governed by SERN.

 All nations (even America!)have disbanded their
 armies.

 To put it simply,civilization has returned to an
 18th century level of technology and exists under a
 communist system of government.

 Except now,that system works flawlessly.

 Right now,you should be asking yourselves how that
 is possible.

 How does a system of government that collapsed in
 the 20th century exist without any discontent?

 The answer to that question is the reason I am here.


 Yes,I am a terrorist.

 There are others like me who fight against SERN.

 We think of ourselves as the Resistance,but there
 is no denying that our actions are a kind of
 terrorism.

RaiNet Kakeru ■Access No. 1
″The rumored guy is no good!? Mystery Transfer Student″

A net cafe in New York City. Someone types an email.
″In an hour,start the cyber attack against the
Department of Defense...″

Yumehara Kakeru is a fifth grader who just recently
transferred to Kaigyou Elementary. Although flawless
in academics and sports,he doesn't particularly stand
out.

His classmates,Kirari and Tamaru,are members of the
school's small computer club,and try to get Kakeru to
join with the reasoning that they need anybody to
increase their numbers.


But Kakeru isn't interested.

[Kirari]
″He's probably not good with computers. It can't be
helped.″

Then one day,during computer class.
Tamaru shows off her touch typing skills to Kakeru.
While rebuking Tamaru for that,Kirari displays her
abundant knowledge of computers and the internet.

[Tamaru]
″Hey,Kirari,look at the transfer student. He's only
using one finger to type.″

[Kirari]
″Come on,stop that,Tamaru. He's just a transfer
student,so he can't help it,can he?″

Everyone in the class looks down on Kakeru's lack of
ability when they see him slowly press keys one by one,
as if confirming each individual keystroke.

It is at that moment that a low whirring sound emerges
from Kakeru's bag.
As everyone looks on in amazement,he reaches in and
pulls out a sub notebook PC that would make any kid
jealous.

Moreover,it has a unique design.

[Tamaru]
″This guy can't be for real! A sub notebook even though
he types one-fingered!?″

[Kirari]
″That's not it,Tamaru. Look,that sub notebook doesn't
have a display!″

[Tamaru]
″Ki-Kirari! I've never seen anything like that! It's
making a screen!″

The ″Upa″ inside Kakeru's sub notebook delivers an
emergency mail from Nagaya-san. Written in the mail is
the surprising news that the Department of Defense has
been hacked.

Upon confirming the contents of the mail,Kakeru's eye
color changes and his movements accelerate to a
surprising rate.

The entire class stares in disbelief as he removes the
screen from the special sub notebook and connects the
keyboard to a school computer.

As emergency countermeasures,he uses the school
computer to begin pursuit of the cracker. Kirari and
Tamaru are astonished when Kakeru starts operating the
keyboard with violent force.

Kakeru pursues the traces of the cracker who hides his
identity by using servers throughout the world. Easily
exterminating obstacles such as trap viruses,he draws
close to his opponent.

The net cafe in New York City. A window opens on the
monitor.
Kakeru finally corners the culprit. Faster than cyber
police units throughout the world,and the CIA,Kakeru
reaches the culprit's computer and accosts him through
chat.

The culprit calls himself ″J.″ J releases viruses. They
are powerful things,which have the ability to force
other people's computers to freeze.

But Kakeru defends himself by shooting a precise
vaccine,slowly approaching the culprit's whereabouts.
The location is found to be somewhere in New York. In
just a few moments,he'll have the exact address...

J is surprised by Kakeru's ability. ″I never thought
I'd have to use this...″ he says as he takes out a
strangely shaped CD-ROM. Kakeru is unable to defend
against the virus released from that CD-ROM.
Furthermore,all of the computers in the classroom are
destroyed by that mystery program.

The battle has ended in Kakeru's complete defeat.
The computer room teacher's face reddens with rage.
 At that time,the school dismissal bell rings. While
feeling regret,Kakeru rollerblades to his meeting with
Nagaya-san.

Kirari and Tamaru,wanting to know what sort of person
 Kakeru is,chase after him. Nagaya-san tells him that
the computer virus J used is the very dangerous Monster
Program ″Vaios.″

The mystery Monster Programs made for an unknown
purpose.

Their destructive force is said to be thousands of
times stronger than normal viruses. There are 9 types
of these unreproducible Monster Programs. It is said
that he who collects all of them can control the entire
internet world.

Simply put,this Monster Program is legendary on the
internet.
And a hacker has appeared who can use it.
This is a global state of emergency.

″What should we do!?″ Kakeru cries.
In reply,Nagaya-san takes out a gaudy-looking input
card.

″We're not just going to stand here and watch. We're
just about finished developing a new RaiNet Card.″

What is this new RaiNet Card?
And what is Kakeru's true identity?

Meanwhile,in New York City--
The net cafe's door opens,and out comes a pretty boy.
″Kakeru,huh... what an interesting guy″
While putting away a strangely shaped CD-ROM,he laughs
like he's enjoying himself.

That boy is the grade school hacker who shook the world
in the past.

″J″--

RaiNet Kakeru ■Access No. 2
″On to the future! RaiNet Formation!″

Completely engrossed by their discussion,Kirari and
Tamaru raise their voices.

″Just what sort of person is Kakeru?″

Kakeru is actually a warrior who protects the order of
the internet:
A Net Guardian.
Kirari and Tamaru wanted to tell their friends how cool
that was.
But Kakeru forbade them due to the risk that he may
have to fight with the culprit.

At that time,they receive news that the mystery hacker
 ″Beesman″ has attacked an online game server. Kakeru
immediately challenges him using Nagaya-san's newly
made RaiNet Card and the unique browser Alpha Gate.

The first use of a new RaiNet Card. Despite his lack of
experience,Kakeru successfully casts his Boot Spell.

But just when Kakeru thinks he has easily won against
the cracker,Beesman,who has complete control of the
game server,overwrites the game system,sealing Kakeru
deep within the game's loop dungeon.

Kakeru is in danger.
At that moment,somehow Kirari and Tamaru also Server
Dive.
They came to save Kakeru!
Furthermore,these two are well versed in this game.
As game players,they couldn't forgive the hacker who
had taken over the server and toyed with the game
players,so they decided to join forces with Kakeru.

With their magnificent assistance,and Kakeru's Shoot
ability,they successfully defeat Beesman.

And when they do,suddenly an unknown chat window opens
on their monitor.

It's a signal from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police
Department.
″By any chance,are they here to praise us?″ they think
in delight,but...

The police turn to them and say--

″You're under arrest!″


RaiNet Kakeru ■Access No. 3
″Pi-po-pi-po-! The Net Police Trap!″

Japan's Net Police do not think well of Kakeru,despite
his commendable deeds. They threaten to prosecute
Kakeru under the Unauthorized Access laws. They don't
press charges this time,but they take credit for
Beesman's arrest and warn Kakeru to keep his nose out
of police business.

″What can children do?″ ridicules Red,a member of the
Net Police.
This angers Kakeru and the others. They know their
hacking skills are a match for any adult's.

Just then,the Police Department's mascot character,
Pipo-kun,appears on their screens saying ″I heard
everything!″ Suddenly,Pipo-kun challenges them to a
contest.

Cybercrime is getting worse by the day. There's no
denying the police need all the help they can get. But
still,there's no way they can just let untrained kids
disrupt an investigation. Therefore,Pipo-kun wants to
test just how capable Kakeru and friends are.

Kakeru and friends win if they can infiltrate the
deepest part of the Metropolitan Police Department's
server where Pipo-kun lives. If Kakeru and friends win,
they will be granted arrest privileges equal to the Net
Police.

Thinking himself unbeatable,Red agrees to the contest.
Thus,the Metropolitan Police Department's server
becomes the stage for the hacking battle.

However,the cowardly Red closes every port to the
server. Ports are like doors that open to the outside.
In other words,Kakeru and friends need to penetrate a
building without entrances.

Without a foundation,Kakeru and friends are at a loss.
However,an idea comes to Kakeru. He skates into town
with Kirari and Tamaru.

With their help,Kakeru successfully infiltrates the
Police Department building. Attaching his sub notebook
through their public phone,with abundant knowledge and
splendid technique,he steadily heads to the depths,
successfully reaching the server!

Pipo-kun declares Kakeru the victor. As promised,they
will receive complete backing from the police. Kakeru
and his friends are overjoyed. However,Red protests
″What right does Pipo-kun have to do that!? This isn't
authorized!″

Just then,the image of Pipo-kun dissolves,revealing
none other than the Police Commisioner himself! That
was Pipo-kun's true identity all along!

When he says ″Isn't youthful strength like theirs
necessary to fight against cyber-crime?″ Red is unable
to object.

And thus,the police-sanctioned ″RaiNet Guardians″ are
born!


RaiNet Kakeru ■Access No. 4
″Computer Club Head Kazuma's pride″

Kirari and Tamaru implore Kakeru to join the Computer
Club.
But the head of the Computer Club,Ichikawa Kazuma from
class 4,says ″Unless I see Kakeru's true skill,I
won't recognize his entry to the club!″

Afterwards,a personal challenge arrives from the
computer of Shidou Elementary. Shidou is a rival school
competing in the typing tournament ″Typing Masters.″

There's no way they can turn down the challenge. And so
the Typing Battle Game between Kazuma and the Shidou
Computer Club Head,″Ima Pyuuta″ began.

At first,Kazuma dominates with a steady score.
However,his opponent,taking advantage of the fact
that he cannot be seen in an online battle,
underhandedly sends a virus program to Kaigyou
Elementary's PC,slowing down its processing speed.

Before he knows it,Kazuma starts losing. Kakeru,
having noticed their opponent is cheating with a dirty
virus,asks to switch places.

[Kazuma]
″The honor of Kaigyou Elementary hangs on this fight.
I'm not just going to switch places with you.″

But Kazuma is blinded by pride. The match is gradually
turning against him.

At this point,even Tamaru and Kirari start pressuring
Kazuma to listen to Kakeru. The whole class holds their
breath as the baton is passed to Kakeru under grave
conditions.

Kazuma has already given up. He bows his head and turns
his back.
But from behind him,comes the sound of typing unlike
any he's ever heard before.

Kazuma looks back in shock after hearing a noise
echoing like a jackhammer. It was Kakeru,crushing the
cheater fair and square,typing at a ferocious pace!

Followed by a splendid victory!
Kazuma threw his arms around Kakeru in relief,
exclaiming ″Please join our Computer Club!″

And then Nagaya-san calls. An online bank cracking
incident has occurred! The enemy is the infamous bank
robber,″Bishop!″

Tension once again runs through Kakeru and friends!


RaiNet Kakeru ■Access No. 5
″Encounter with Bishop,online bank hacker″

These days,Online Banking is widespread. Sometimes
even billions of units of currency are transferred
wirelessly.

The current enemy,″Bishop″ is a tough opponent,
cracking through a mobile connection while driving to
mask his location.

But Kakeru reads his opponent's moves one by one and
gradually corners him. In order to close the distance,
Kakeru and friends don rollerblades,moving between
hotspots and public phone lines in town!

With Kakeru's swift techniques and precise strikes,
along with Tamaru's group's teamwork,they successfully
corner Bishop!

Out of options,their target uses his last resort!
One of the 9 existing phantom Monster Programs,
″Terios!″

Its capacity for wanton destruction instantly turns the
tables on Kakeru. Bishop prepares to use Terios to
deliver the finishing blow.

The vile virus approaches!

Checkmate for Kakeru!! But then,as if to protect them,
something flies out of Kakeru's PC!

It's the virtual pet Upa that Kakeru cared for!

Upa intercepts the hit meant for Kakeru.

Will Upa be okay!?
RaiNet Kakeru ■Access No. 6
″To the trial,upaupa! Upa's secret″

Upa has taken a direct attack from the Monster-level
virus.

But he is unscathed. And of all things,he devours the
attack itself.

Kakeru has successfully countered Bishop with Upa's
great efforts. On top of that,he has obtained Bishop's
Monster Program ″Terios.″

But he doesn't understand. Why could Upa devour such a
strong Monster-level virus program?

Not even Nagaya-san knows. But the mystery Site Master
″Cyber Dragon″ might.

Cyber Dragon,who has information about every program
in existence,is like a sage with knowledge of the
entire net world.

Kakeru and friends begin searching for Cyber Dragon's
site immediately.

In order to obtain the URL for Cyber Dragon's site,it
appears they'll need to clear the online game,″Cyber
Dragon Trial.″

This is a typing battle with increasing viral attacks,
wearing Kakeru down.

But he keeps going,cheered on by his friends. After a
grueling struggle,Kakeru successfully gets the URL for
Cyber Dragon's site.

They finally manage to meet Cyber Dragon.

As his name suggests,he takes the form of an elder
dragon. He inspects Upa's program.

What he discovers is that Upa iss also a Monster
Program.

Kirari worries Upa is dangerous. Cyber Dragon,however,
explains that based on the user's will,a deadly weapon
can also become a tool to protect.

Unfortunately,that also means it will be necessary to
awaken Upa's inner Monster Program.

And if Kakeru fails to fully master it,he may lose
control of the awakened form.

Without knowing how to awaken Upa,Kakeru and friends
leave Cyber Dragon's site.

In order to overcome the vile programs,Kakeru pledges
to discover Upa's Monster Program boot process.

Before long,rumors spread around the world of Kakeru
and friends,the amazing grade schoolers who possess
a Monster Program.

″First in aircraft history! Ground hijack!″

Japan prepares to send a team to the Typing Masters
world championships in Los Angeles.

Among Japan's representatives is Kakeru,who has become
an instant celebrity for solving numerous cybercrimes.

Tamaru accompanies as second,and Kirari's wealth lets
her pay her own way. While they're chatting on the
plane,an emergency suddenly occurs.

The cabin crew frantically approaches them. It appears
that someone has hijacked the jumbo jet.

Moreover,the culprit is not onboard. Somehow,he
hijacked the computer systems from the ground.

The crew cannot not switch to manual control,letting
the hacker decrease the plane's altitude along with its
276 passengers.

Without needing a single explosive,the culprit instead
was bringing the plane down by halting its engines
electronically:the century's first ″Ground Hijack!″

The hacker wants the Monster Program ″Upa.″
Kakeru infiltrates the jet with his sub notebook and
tries to  trace the hacker,but can't.

The only line that connects to the jet is the heavily
protected control tower's.

Searching for the core of that line... fails.
There is no suspicious activity from the tower.
Kakeru and friends grow impatient.

Only special radio waves should have been able to reach
the plane's height from the tower.

However,considering other possibilities,Kakeru comes
up with another idea:via satellite.

″Bingo!″ Kakeru was right. The ground base is connected
to the satellite through an external line.

The culprit broke the satellite's firewall to connect
to the plane's computer systems. Both a satellite and a
plane were hijacked in this major incident.

Kakeru figures this out and corners the culprit. The
first war fought at the core of an orbiting satellite
begins. A quick victory.

The opponent is clever,but not enough to match
Kakeru's methods. Kakeru and friends watch the first
space battle unfold on screen.

The jumbo jet is almost as beautiful as a shuttle
floating in space. Stars are reflected in Kakeru's
eyes.

Next,the world Typing Masters championship begins.

″Echo,Inazuma! Typing Masters' Secrets!″

Despite the incident,they safely land in Los Angeles.
As they exit the crowded terminal,they notice an
American youth helping an old lady with her suitcase.

[Tamaru]
″Heh,so Americans are kind people too.″

[Kirari]
″Considerate people live in every country.″

After a 30 minute bus ride from the airport,they
arrive at the LA convention center.

An aura of feverish competition spreads through the
Typing Master grounds.

Most surprisingly,the list of participants includes
even world famous hackers and crackers.

Since they leave no evidence,they evade wanted lists.

And among them is the name of their fated opponent,
″J.″ They have not yet met in person.

[Tamaru]
″I bet he looks like a scoundrel.″

The battles are live-streamed worldwide on the
internet,where they're as popular as the Olympics!

The tournament starts the main race. An energetic DJ
announces the top 8. 7th called is Kakeru,and last is
″J's″ name.

That last face... is the face of the boy who helped the
lady in the airport!

The 3 are shocked. Who is he? By now,Kakeru is the
last Japanese competitor remaining. Another one,Red's
subordinate,lost in the first round.

All they can do is root for Kakeru.
Kakeru's first top 8 opponent is the rhythmic Dancing
Typist ″Lost Shade,″ who proves no match for Kakeru's
speed.

Kakeru advances. His next opponent is ″Indra Panther″
son of an Arabian oil baron.

His limber yoga movements make him appear to be
jointless. It's a hard match since his movement
patterns leave no openings.

But Kakeru uses a freezing virus attack,sealing his
opponent's moves. Finally,one light touch shatters him
like ice.

Now it's the finals! As expected,the opponent is the
mysterious ″J.″

How will this match turn out!?

RaiNet Kakeru ■Access No. 9
″Decisive battle! And... begin!″

″Bunshin no jutsu″ would be an appropriate name for J's
technique. His movements are so fast it's like there
are four of him typing at the same time.

His self-taught typing method is nicknamed ″Cross
Ripper.″ J is fairly famous in America's underworld,
and many imitate this style.

It gets its name from his arms overlapping eachother in
the shape of a cross.

Of course,Kakeru also has a unique skill,nicknamed
″Thunder Gladiator.″

The friction between his fingers and keys,caused by
his typing speed,generates a small electric current
like lightning from his fingertips that gradually
builds up.

They are evenly matched. The first set goes to Kakeru,
and the second to J. The outcome hinges on the last
round.

Final match. Sparks fly in this grand head-to-head
fight. The struggle is projected onto large display
panels. The audience holds their breath. However,the
match is suddenly interrupted by a power outage.

This isn't a normal problem. Typically,the UPS
(Uninterruptible Power Supply)would activate,and the
machines would continue functioning.

The battle between the two ends with a temporary truce.
As the organizer becomes impatient,the audience
begins to stir restlessly.

...Suddenly,a strange logo appears on every monitor,
and words slowly materialize one letter at a time.

「I am a Monster. You are friend? hahahaha」

Along with the ominous message,tiny electronic sounds
can be heard.

[J]
″Kakeru! Move!″

J suddenly pushes Kakeru away and forcibly unplugs
Kakeru's keyboard from the tourney PC.

As soon as he does,sparks fly from the USB port...

His all-important player keyboard narrowly avoids
shorting. It seems like J saved Kakeru.

[Kakeru]
″Th-thanks″

[J]
″Hmph,don't thank me. I just can't have a match
without an opponent.″

With those words,J turns and leaves.
Though the finals end with J and Kakeru tied for first
place,J disappears without accepting the trophy.

Naturally,Kakeru also declines it. The true winner
will be decided at their rematch next year.

Mystery boy J. Kakeru and friends are unaware that
soon,J will join them as a member of the RaiNet team.

Tamaru decides to track down Ayumi's site and is

After investigating,he finds it was the simple prank

While they're left defenseless,J talks to Kakeru via
voice chat.

[J]
″Kakeru,why do you try to stop me?″

[Kakeru]
″Why are you doing this!? Is suffering really that fun
for you!?″

J's answer is that he is merely testing his own power.
To see if he can break the unbreakable,steal the
unstealable. To test himself... is that not why Kakeru
became a Net Guardian?

Kakeru says that's not true. After saying that Kakeru's
not being honest,J departs.

After hearing J's words,Kakeru finds himself wavering,
wondering why he really became a Net Guardian. He
wanted to make use of his brilliant knowledge and
technique handed down to him by his father.

He didn't gain power with the goal of becoming a
Guardian.

[Kakeru]
″Did I become a Guardian just to test my own power?″

Kakeru is troubled. Sitting in front of his computer,
he doubts his own heart.

Japanese Traffic Ministry's main computer.

Accidents are happening everywhere. While tragic
news-flashes continue,Kakeru is unable to fight back.

The way to awaken Upa... His father once mentioned
something about it.

[Kakeru's Father]
″Never sink to underhanded techniques.
True strength is in the cards.″

The way to awaken Upa is to seal the entirety of his

Since taking Upa out of the computer means uninstalling
(killing)him,Kakeru knows it's risky. However,
Operation Awaken Upa is a huge success!

Upa's power increases beyond comprehension.
While Kakeru's overwhelming technique and Upa's
awakened power manage to overcome J,he manages to find
an opening and flee.

     I see that everyone would like to know more about my time machine.
     I'm happy to explain.
     Just so you know,it's impossible to reproduce with current technology.
     Certain critical components won't exist until SERN invents them in 2034..

     Time travel works by altering gravity.
     Basically,you can think of it as using the twin paradox.
     But that alone isn't enough to reverse time.

     The twin paradox? Is that like the Urashima effect?
     That's just slowing time down,not reversing it.

     By Tipler cylinders,are you referring to the Tipler machine?
     lolwut?

     A Tipler cylinder would have to be 10km in diameter,1000km long,
     have mass equal to the sun,and revolve 2500 times per second to become a
     time machine lol
     How do you fit that onto a Chevy?
     Even if you could,a Tipler Machine can't travel farther back in time than
     the moment of its creation.

     Enough of your delusions
     @channel is not your blog
     I want to hear from Titor

     This is a surprise.
     Does this mean people of this age already know about my time machine?
     Did you really encounter me ten years ago?
     If so,then that must have been on another worldline.
     I,at least,have not gone to the year 2000.

     In any case,the important point is that a rotating black hole has the same
     effect as a Tipler cyclinder.
     You can learn more about Kerr black holes by
     studying the Penrose diagram or Tipler's calculations.
     My time machine works by generating a pair of Kerr black holes.

     All aboard Hououin's crazy train,prepare for a trainwreck!

     Kerr black hole time travel is theoretically possible,but


     1. How do you get black holes to spin? Don't tell me you wait until you
     find one spinning naturally. That's ridiculous.

     2. How do you pass through the [color index="8C0000"]singularity[color index="800000"]?
     There's no way a Chevy can withstand the pressure.

     This isn't a delusion.
     I know for a fact that Titor posted ten years ago.
     There's even a book about it. Search the used book stores if you don't
     believe me.

     His Chevy has a gravity distortion unit.
     That's what he said ten years ago.


312 :[color index="8E0000"]JOHN TITOR◆f8VuYnoyWU[color index="800000"]:2010/07/29(Thu) 15:37:55 ID:4Co5c6io0

     Yes,it does have a gravity distortion unit.
     My time machine is not perfect. It was built by a third party who
     reverse-engineered SERN's design.
     The gravity distortion unit is a little unstable.

     First,the unit produces a micro singularity,then injects electrons to
     induce rapid rotation.
     This generates a local gravity sine wave.
     As the time machine passes through the singularity,the gravity distortion
     unit regulates the pressure to ensure safe passage.
     I'm not a specialist,so I cannot explain the mechanics any further.

     Let me just say that Kerr black holes can be manufactured.

     I assume everyone's aware of SERN's current experiments with black hole
     creation.

     It's not that you won't explain,it's that you can't,lol.

     How do you set the destination? The Earth is constantly moving,or didn't
     you know that?

     By the way,I propose the Titor = Hououin theory lol.

     I set the destination with the VGL system.
     That's Variable Gravity Lock.
     It functions by reading the local gravity of the destination and locking
     the Tipler sine wave onto that location.
     By locking onto Earth's gravity,it ensures that I don't end up floating in
     space.
     It uses four cesium clocks to make the calculations,so the margin of error
     is negligible.
